            <p>
                Born 10 September 1964 (age 55)
                Hangzhou, China
            </p>
            <h2>
                Early life and education
            </h2>
            <p>
                Jack Ma was born Ma Yun on 10 September 1964 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. When Ma was twelve, he bought
                a pocket radio. He started to listen to English radio everyday and gradually loved English. He began
                studying English at a young age by conversing with English-speakers at Hangzhou International Hotel. For
                nine years, Ma would ride 17 miles on his bicycle to give tourists tours of the area to practice his
                English. He became pen pals with one of those foreigners, who nicknamed him "Jack" because he found it
                hard to pronounce his Chinese name.
                Later in his youth, Ma struggled attending college. The Chinese entrance exams are held only once a year
                and Ma took four years to pass. The main reason was Ma was bad at mathematics. Ma attended Hangzhou
                Teacher's Institute (currently known as Hangzhou Normal University) and graduated in 1988 with a
                Bachelor of Arts in English. While at school, Ma was head of the student council. After graduation, he
                became a lecturer in English and international trade at Hangzhou Dianzi University. He also applied ten
                times to Harvard Business School and got rejected each time.Ma applied for 30 different jobs and got
                rejected by all. "I went for a job with the police; they said, 'you're no good'", Ma told interviewer
                Charlie Rose. "I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job.
                Twenty-three were accepted. I was the only guy ...".
                In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet and also started his first company, Hangzhou Haibo Translation
                Agency. In early 1995, he went to the US with his friends, who helped introduce him to the Internet.
                Although he found information related to beer from many countries, he was surprised to find none from
                China. He also tried to search for general information about China and again was surprised to find none.
                So he and his friend created an "ugly" website related to China. He launched the website at 9:40 AM, and
                by 12:30 PM he had received emails from some Chinese investors wishing to know about him. This was when
                Ma realized that the Internet had something great to offer. In April 1995, Ma and He Yibing (a computer
                teacher) opened the first office for China Pages and Ma started their second company. On May 10, 1995,
                they registered the domain chinapages.com in the United States. Within three years, the company had made
                5,000,000 Chinese Yuan which at the time was equivalent to US$800,000.
                Ma began building websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the US. He said that "The
                day we got connected to the Web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house", and on a very slow
                dial-up connection, "we waited three and a half hours and got half a page", he recalled. "We drank,
                watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved the Internet existed". At a
                conference in 2010, Ma revealed that he has never actually written a line of code nor made one sale to a
                customer. He acquired a computer for the first time at the age of 33.
                From 1998 to 1999, Ma headed an information technology company established by the China International
                Electronic Commerce Center, a department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In
                1999, he quit and returned to Hangzhou with his team to found Alibaba, a China-based
                business-to-business marketplace site in his apartment with a group of 18 friends. He started a new
                round of venture development with 500,000 yuan.

                Jack Ma at 2007 China Trust Global Leaders Forum
                In October 1999 and January 2000, Alibaba twice won a total of a $25 million foreign venture capital
                investment. The program was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce
                platform for Chinese enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to address World
                Trade Organization (WTO) challenges. Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system and from 2003 he
                founded Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Ali Mama and Lynx. After the rapid rise of Taobao, eBay offered to
                purchase the company. However, Ma rejected their offer, instead gathering support from Yahoo co-founder
                Jerry Yang with a $1 billion investment.
                In September 2014 it was reported Alibaba was raising over $25 billion in an initial public offering
                (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange.[26] Alibaba became one of the most valuable technology companies
                in the world after raising the full $25 billion, the largest initial public offering in US financial
                history. Ma served as executive chairman of Alibaba Group, which is a holding company with nine major
                subsidiaries: Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan,
                1688.com, AliExpress.com, and Alipay. In November 2012, Alibaba's online transaction volume exceeded one
                trillion yuan. As of 2016, Ma is the owner of Château de Sours in Bordeaux, Chateau Guerry in Côtes de
                Bourg and Château Perenne in Blaye, Côtes de Bordeaux.
                On 9 January 2017, Ma met with United States President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, to discuss the
                potential of 1 million job openings in the following five years through Alibaba's interest in the
                country. On 8 September 2017, to celebrate Alibaba's 18th year of establishment, Ma appeared on stage
                and gave a Michael-Jackson-inspired performance. He performed part of "Can You Feel The Love Tonight" at
                the 2009 Alibaba birthday event while dressed as a heavy metal lead singer. In the same month, Ma also
                partnered with Sir Li Ka-shing in a joint venture to offer a digital wallet service in Hong Kong.
                Ma announced on 10 September 2018 that he would step down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding
                in the coming year. Ma denied reports that he was forced to step aside by the Chinese government. and
                stated that he wants to focus on philanthropy through his foundation. Daniel Zhang would then lead the
                way ahead for Alibaba as the current executive chairman.

                Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009
                In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
                CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
                Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software
                in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a
                joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4]
                from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia
                first.

            Markup
            HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
            character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in
            pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>.
            The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
            tags and closing tags).
            </p>
            <p>
                <h1> Elements </h1>
                Main article: HTML element
                HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML
                tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: <p>.[71][better source needed]
                    In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
                    <p> and "end tag" </p>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
                    Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and
                    text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.
                    The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as
                    identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the
                    presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the
                    reference to the image resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                    HTML Application
                    Main article: HTML Application
                    An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ".hta") is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML
                    and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file
                    is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers
                    and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application
                    and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry
                    entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via
                    HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.
            </p>
            <p>     Attributes
                    Main article: HTML attribute
                    Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written within the
                    start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double
                    quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not
                    XHTML).[73][74] Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[75] In contrast with
                    name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their
                    presence in the start tag of the element,[6] like the ismap attribute for the img element.[76]
                    There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :
                    The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify
                    the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter,
                    animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a
                    globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID
                    "Attributes" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes.
                    The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or
                    presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation
                    <class="notation"> to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main
                        text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as
                        footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class
                        attributes are used semantically in microformats. Multiple class values may be specified; for
                        example <class="notation important"> puts the element into both the notation and the important
                            classes.
                            An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular
                            element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to
                            select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for
                            a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.
                            The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers
                            this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.
